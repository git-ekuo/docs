## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using Bearer tokens.

You can generate your Bearer Token by:

1. Click on your Profile Pic (top right hand side corner)
2. Click on "Developers" item.
3. Click "Generate API Key" to generate your own API Key that you would pass as Bearer Token for all your API requests.

```json
"security": [
  {
    "bearerAuth": []
  }
]
```
